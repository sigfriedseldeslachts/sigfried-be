This is my personal website and blog created using [Nuxt.js](https://nuxtjs.org).

No backend is used, the projects are specified in a JS file in the `plugins` folder. Blog posts are stored as Markdown files in the `content` folder.

## Building

```bash
# Install dependencies
$ yarn install

# Serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ yarn dev

# Build for production and launch server
$ yarn build
$ yarn start

# Generate static project
$ yarn generate
```

For detailed explanation on how things work, check out the [Nuxt.js documentation](https://nuxtjs.org).
